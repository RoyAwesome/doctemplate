## The one that updates to 5.0

### Version Naming Scheme Change

Starting with 1.4.0, the version scheme has changed.  The Version Scheme now matches closer to SemVer, with Major.Minor.Patch-githash.  The Githash replaces the old changelist number in the previous version.  Note: If you access Arc Teams on the Puny Human Github, the version will always be Major.Minor.X-git, for all major/minors.  I do not update the patch or githash for git distributions.  

### Changenotes

- Updated plugin to support 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2
- Fixed the DisplayDebug Crash in 5.2
- Added Replicated Subobject support for 5.1+
- Added IsPlayerInTeam helper function to ArcTeam
- Fixed a bug where in server context, OnTeamAdded would fire before a parent team was set, leading the server to believe that subteams were primary teams.
